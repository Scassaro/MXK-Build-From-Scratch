# MXK-Build-From-Scratch
From defaulting an MXK system, to a fully network connected device.

Essentially, starting an MXK system from scratch takes a good deal of time and attention. This program is intended to make that process just a bit easier, but simplifying the process to four dialog windows.

NOTE: This program requires a decent deal of knowledge about an MXK system, familiarity with the inner working of MXK systems, and some knowledge of networking principles.
