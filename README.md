# MXK-Build-From-Scratch
From defaulting an MXK system, to a fully network connected device.

Essentially, starting an MXK system from scratch is pain in the ass (shocker right? It is a Zhone device after all). This program is intended to make that process just a bit easier.

NOTE: This program requires a decent deal of knowledge about an MXK system, familiarity with the inner working of MXK systems (read: it's a nightmare), and some knowledge of networking principles.
